# Description

- Animal shelters provide a crucial service for the homeless animals awaiting adoption into a loving home, as
well as for the humans who enjoy the comfort and companionship that a beloved pet can offer. However,
one problem with the animal adoption process is that it often allows animals to be adopted by humans with
whom they are not fully compatible. A shelterâ€™s animals and the human clients who adopt them may be
mismatched in a variety of ways, including in terms of temperament, needs, and expectations. The
Carleton University Animal Care System (cuACS) proposes to address this issue by providing a tool that
automatically matches together, based on compatibility, shelter animals and the human clients who wish to
adopt them. The goal of the cuACS system is to generate an optimal set of matches, where a match
consists of an animal available for adoption and a human client who is well suited to adopt it. An optimal
set of matches will take into account the best interests of all animals in the shelter, rather than producing a
small subset of highly favourable matches and a large number of lesser compatible ones.
